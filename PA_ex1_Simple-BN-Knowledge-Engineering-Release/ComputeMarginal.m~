%ComputeMarginal Computes the marginal over a set of given variables
%   M = ComputeMarginal(V, F, E) computes the marginal over variables V
%   in the distribution induced by the set of factors F, given evidence E
%
%   M is a factor containing the marginal over variables V
%   V is a vector containing the variables in the marginal e.g. [1 2 3] for
%     X_1, X_2 and X_3.
%   F is a vector of factors (struct array) containing the factors 
%     defining the distribution
%   E is an N-by-2 matrix, each row being a variable/value pair. 
%     Variables are in the first column and values are in the second column.
%     If there is no evidence, pass in the empty matrix [] for E.

% step1: calculate Joint distribution
Joint = ComputeJointDistribution(M);

% step2: include evidence in Joint distribution
Joint_E = ObserveEvidence(Joint,E);
% remove rows with zero probability
% only keep probabilities in table which are not 0
non_zero_idx = find(Joint_E.val ~= 0);
% fetch non-zero probability values
non_zero_values = Joint_E.val(non_zero_idx);
% normalize the non_zero_values
non_zero_values = non_zero_values/norm(non_zero_values);
% finally construct the correct factor after reduction and normalization
% NOTE: Joint_and_E_N: Joint Distribution which we applied ObserveEvidence
% on and finally normalized all probabilities while removing 0 prob entries
