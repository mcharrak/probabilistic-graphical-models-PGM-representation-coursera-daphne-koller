<h2 class="topictitle"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC0000">Editing Conditional Probabilities</font></h2>
<p class="topicparagraph">Once you have designed the structure of a Bayesian network,
  the next step is to quantitatively define the conditional dependencies between
  variables. In SamIam,
  the user can accomplish this by
  editing a table of conditional
  probability values for each variable in the belief network. The probability-editing
  table for a node is part of the <font class="keyword">node properties dialog
  window</font>. Show the node properties dialog window either by double-clicking
  the icon for the node in the network view, or by right-clicking it and selecting
  the context menu item labeled &quot;Properties.&quot; The first tab of the node
  properties dialog displays editable qualitative information about the node,
  including the identifier, name, and a list of its discrete states. Additional
  states can be inserted and removed to change state cardinality.
  SamIam requires that variable identifiers be unique in the context of one network.
  This window also displays Genie-specific
  information about the node, including the probability representation semantics
  for the node, which can be either CPT or noisy-or,
  and in the table of states, the
  target and default flags for each state.
<p class="topicparagraph">The <font class="keyword">probability-editing</font>
  table appears in the tab labeled &quot;Probabilities.&quot; This tab contains
  a title indicating whether the table is a full conditional probability
  table, a table of noisy-or weights,
  or a table of sensitivity lock settings.
  The upper half of the table contains a row for
  each parent variable. The lower half contains a row for each discrete state
  of the child variable. Thus, the probability values in each column of the table
  must sum to 1. You can edit the value of a single parameter in the table by
  double-clicking the table cell for that entry.

<p class="topicparagraph">The <font class="keyword">Probabilities</font> tab also
  provides some useful functions for working with the probability table. The <font class="keyword">Resize</font>
  button will expand every column of the table to make the probability numbers
  fully visible. This can be useful when you would like to inspect a lot of numbers
  for which a high decimal precision causes the widths of the numbers themselves
  on the screen to overflow the bounds of the table cells that contain them. The
  <font class="keyword">Complement</font> button provides an automatic mathematical
  function for calculating the value of one table parameter based on the values
  of the other parameters that appear in its column. To use the Complement function,
  choose a table column you would like to work with and provide a probability
  value for each entry in the column but one. Next, single-click the remaining
  entry you have left undefined. You will notice that the column of interest is
  now in a selected state, as indicated by the background color of the table cells.
  Also, the background color of the table cell containing the selected parameter
  itself identifies it in its column. Next, click the <font class="keyword">Complement</font>
  button. The value of the selected parameter will take on the value of the complement
  of the remainder of the numbers for that condition (i.e. 1 - sum of other numbers).
  The <font class="keyword">Normalize</font> button provides an automatic mathematical
  function for setting the values of all the probability numbers in one column.
  To use it, first left-click any table cell in the column you are interested
  in normalizing. You will notice that the column is selected. Next, click the
  <font class="keyword">Normalize</font> button. Each number in the column will
  be divided by the sum of the column entries. This results in the new sum = 1
  for the probability numbers in the normalized column. <br>
