<p class="topicparagraph" align="left">
There are several ways SamIam allows a user to <font class="keyword">assert</font> 
and <font class="keyword">retract</font> evidence on variables in a Bayesian 
network. The simplest way to set an evidence value is by using the <font class="keyword">Evidence 
Tree view</font>, which is the leftmost window that appears in SamIam when a 
network is open. The Evidence Tree contains a tree-style list of every node 
in each sub model of the network (in the case of networks defined in the Hugin 
.net file format, there will be only one sub model), sorted lexicographically 
according to node names,
and divided according to an enumerated variable property you choose,
for example, Genie diagnosis type.
Expanding the tree branch of a node reveals tree leaves 
for each of its defined states. Single-clicking the mouse on one of these states 
asserts that the variable is in that state with probability 1. SamIam indicates 
such an assertion visually by highlighting the name of the variable in the tree, the 
name of the asserted state, and the border of the node icon in the network display,
by default in the color red. To retract evidence 
that has been set on a variable, single-click the name of the asserted state. 
Evidence can also be set by using the <font class="keyword"><a href="monitors.html" target="_self">Monitors</a></font>.
</p>
<p class="topicparagraph" align="left">
By right-clicking the background of the 
Evidence Tree window with the mouse, the user can pop up a context menu that 
provides a few convenient ways to set evidence on multiple variables at once. 
The first menu item, <font class="keyword">Reset Evidence</font>, will retract evidence on every asserted 
variable. The menu item <font class="keyword">Set Defaults</font> pertains to
Genie files
only. Choosing this item will assert the default evidence on the variables in 
the network, if the user has defined such defaults using Genie.
</p>
<p class="topicparagraph">
The instantiation clipboard is a new feature of SamIam 2.2 that can make working with evidence
more convenient.  The instantiation clipboard, accessible through the Tools menu, is a place where
the user can save an instantiation over an arbitrary number of discrete finite variables, and recall
the instantiation later.  The user can copy the currently set evidence to the clipboard, or copy
the answer to a MAP or MPE query.  Once he has copied a useful instantiation, the user can save it
to a file and load it later.
